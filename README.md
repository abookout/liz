# Liz
This simple program can be used to figure out what your name is ACTUALLY short for.
Dan, I'm sorry, I know this may be hard for you to hear but your mother and I
actually named you Dandruff. Or perhaps Dandelion. Or Dancer. Or Bandana. The
possibilities are numerous!

## Setup
This program requires the Pronouncing library, which you can install with
`pip install pronouncing`. 

You'll also need a dictionary of words in the right format. Lucky for you, you
can find one [right here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json). Just drop it into the same directory as the program.

## Running it
Run the program with `python3 liz.py`.
